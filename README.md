# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview 
The Disaster Reporting Network requested a web page that shows earthquakes within the last seven days. The magnitude and the location of the earthquakes are noted by pop-up markers on the maps. Initially, both a street view map and a satellite map were created. Then, the Disaster Reporter Network requested that the tectonic plates and major earthquakes be shown on the map . Additionally, they requested an additional map. 

## Resources
- Data: 
  - Tectonic Data: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates; 
  - Major Earthquakes Data:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
- Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs, Leaflet
